* store_cgnew_std.py - it stores the coarse graining density data into numpy arrays, it applies the anisotropic corrections and it computes T, mu_B and s according to the UrQMD HG EoS

* make_cg_plots.py - it makes 2D plots along the transverse plane at fixed z of several quantities stored as pickled files by store_cgnew_std.py

* store_cgnew_w_landau_frame_testing.py - under development, it is similar to store_cgnew_std.py, but optionally it uses the Landau frame
