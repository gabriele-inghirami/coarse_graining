SHORT - MEDIUM TERM:
- check and test to_landau.c
- extend to_text.c to the output of to_landau.exe
- extend to_2D.c to the output of to_landau.exe

MEDIUM TERM:
- take the information for the average process from the files, so that one does not need to have matching binaries

LONG TERM:
- use a different procedure to identify particles, the current hardcoded switch/if scheme makes difficult to include new hadrons
- restructure output in a more scalable way
